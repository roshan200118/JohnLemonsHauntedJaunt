 Play as John Lemon to escape the haunted house. Developed following this tutorial: https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner. Developed using C#, Visual Studio, and Unity 3D. (2022).

Same as tutorial but added teleport feature.
There are 3 teleport pads total (red, green, orange).
Only one way teleport, so player can't go back.
If player stands on pad, player is teleported to corresponding teleport pad.
